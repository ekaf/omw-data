This is an LMF file for the OMW English Wordnet based on Princeton Wordnet 3.0.

It differs from Princeton Wordnet 3.0 in the following ways:

 * It has a patch applied to stop a hyponym loop in *inhibit*
   based on a patch from Ben Haskell <ben@clarity.princeton.edu>

 * verb group '$' is mapped to 'similar'

 * multiword entries use ' ' as a word separator rather than '_'

 * glosses are split into definitions and examples

 * information on adjective position is stored as adjposition: ip
